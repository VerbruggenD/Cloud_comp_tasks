# Fine calculator for car drivers
To calculate the fines of drivers based on income, derived from the value of the car.
This project will be presented during an online meet.
Only the added code is added to this repository to keep the size down.

## The API and consumer:
- Start at index.html, it is just a splash page to continue to the client
- You can choose a manufacturer by selecting an option in the dropdown
- This selects the available models of that manufacturer in the model dropdown
- Then you can calculate the fine, which is done by:
    - getting the average fine for that make and adding the offset of the model
    - only a limited amount of cars are added to the database but the results are a representation of the real life scenario
